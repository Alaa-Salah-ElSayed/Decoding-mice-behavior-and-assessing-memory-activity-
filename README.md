# Decoding-mice-behavior-and-assessing-memory-activity
It is training project that I did in [Imbizo](https://github.com/isicnimbizo).I tried to decode the mice behavior based on performing a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) task using the Steinmetz dataset.

# By going in 2 domains assessing :

  1- Neural activity:
      
  2- Memory activity
